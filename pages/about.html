 Welcome, I am a Junior at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. Having grown up in a family owned accounting office, I have a natural interest in business and a developed passion for technology. Considering both, I am majoring in Business Administration with a minor in Computer Science. Another passion is traveling the world, with the most recent expedition being a study abroad in Costa Rica. Speaking of which, I can hold a conversation in Spanish a bit better than I can hold water in my hands, but am frequent to try. Lastly, I am interested in improving the world one day at a time especially with the club Do Random Acts of Kindness of which I am the Director.
